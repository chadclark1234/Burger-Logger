## Description

This project was to create an application using Express, Handlebars, Mysql and Nodejs.

## Challenges

This project was very difficult for me as there were many new npm packages that were required to be used.

## Credits

I used the Cat activity from class as a template for this project. I found it very rewarding that while making changes and breaking and repairing code I was able to walk through the application step by step. Also, thanks to my tutor for helping with some of the issues I ran into.
